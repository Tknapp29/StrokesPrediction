<h1>Strokes Prediction</h1>
<p>This project contains data on predicting strokes using various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Deep Neural Network (DNN), Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM)</p>

<h2>Files</h2>
<p>Stroke: Contains the implementation, visualizations, performance metrics and insights from the dataset</p>

<h2>How to run</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Install Jupyter Notebook</li>
  <li>Open `Stroke.ipynb` inside Jupyter Notebook. It is suggested to run the file line by line rather than running the whole file at once</li>
</ul>

<h2>Resources</h2>
The dataset used for the project contains features related to stroke prediction such as gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, marriage status, work type, residence type, glucose level and smoking status.
